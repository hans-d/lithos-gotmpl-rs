This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Go project or
Masterminds. It aims to provide a Rust implementation inspired by the
behaviour of Go's `text/template` package and the `sprig` helper library.

This distribution bundles or references test data and tooling that are based on
third-party works:

   Go-based `go-sanity` utility in this repository invokes this library to
   cross-check helper semantics.
